Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and the way the computer interprets it.

Each data type has a different size. You've studied 5 different data types and the sizes of the data types:

Long: 8 bytes

Integer: 4 bytes Float: 4 bytes Double: 8 bytes Character: 1 byte

You're given a data type. Print its size in bytes.

Example:

Input: Long

Output: 8

Explanation: The size of a Long variable is given as 8

bytes.

Detailed explanation (Input/output format, Notes, Images)

Input Format:

The first line contains a string 'type', the data type

given.

Output Format:

Print the size of the data type in bytes.
Note:

You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.

Sample Input 1:

Long

Sample Output 1:

Explanation Of Sample Input 1:

The size of a Long variable is given as 8 bytes.

Sample Input 2:

Float

Sample Output 2:

Explanation Of Sample Input 2:

The size of a Float variable is given as 4 bytes.
Explanation Of Sample Input 2:

The size of a Float variable is given as 4 bytes.

Expected Time Complexity:

The expected time complexity is 0(1).

Constraints:

'type' is one of the data types given above.

Time limit: 1 second
